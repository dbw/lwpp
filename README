# LightWrap++ V0.1

LightWrap++ (or lwpp for short) is a C++ wrapper for the SDK of LightWave 3D by Newtek.

lwpp was designed with the following goals in mind:

- Complete compliance with C++ concepts
- Easy of use
- The ability to quickly start writing a plugin, only adding code as needed
- Use of the STL where appropriated (currently mostly strings and the odd vector/map)
- Compatibility across a range of LW SDK versions (since commercial plugins usually need to be compatible for a longer time).
